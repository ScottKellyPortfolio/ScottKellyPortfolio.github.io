		<p class="newparagraph"><img src="Headshot.jpg" id="headshotpic"></img>I'm an aspiring programmer looking to continuously sharpen and hone my skills in the industry.  I've not always been a coder and have recently made the decision and taken the risk to change careers.   My background varies but my main focus was drag racing. I worked on a professional team working at the highest level of drag racing.  I have always loved tinkering with computers and building them which was what made me decide to make the switch.</p> 

		<p class="newparagraph">I grew up in Brownsburg, IN where I was born.  My free time is spent in many different ways.  Coming from a racing background, I love cars and motorcycles, working on them, and racing them.  I race my motorcycle and periodically my car whenever I get a chance.  One of may favorite things to do is camping.  My family and I have been a part of a church camping group for many years.  It is one of my favorite pastimes.  I have a golden retriever and a cat which are two of my best buds.  I also enjoy playing video games and overall tinkering with my desktop that I built at home.</p>
