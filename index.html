					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						I am a fan of tech. Period. Whether it's at work learning new technologies, languages, tools, or at home reading about the latest gadgets, smartphones, computer components, whatever.
						That's what inspires me. I love learning new, techy, nerdy things.
						<br>
						<br>
						Professionally, I'm a software engineer/software developer. I specialize in 'back-end' and Microsoft technolocies, such as .NET Framework, .NET Core, C#, SQL Server, but I am pretty well rounded in other technologies as well.
						I have built my own REST APIs in my own personal projects, consumed (mmmm, tasty) a myriad of other APIs, mainly REST, and have built web services and REST APIs based on existing platforms. I personally quite enjoy building, testing, and working with APIs (again, mainly REST).
						My main interests in back-end work are building de-coupled systems with API integrations, data analysis, and optimizing code. I am always wanting to learn more with algorithms, lower level operations and such, but don't have much experience with them.
						I find those challenges difficult and rewarding and would love an opportunity to learn more.
						<br>
						<br>
						I also have experience in front-end work and have done a great deal with HTML, CSS, Javascript (JS), jQuery, some Angular and React.
						I enjoy trying to learn new front-end frameworks and seeing what works well for me and what I find the most useful.
						While my focus isn't necessarily front-end work, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it or I'm not competent.
						<br>
						<br>
						Personally, I was born and raised in Brownsburg, Indiana, where I still currently reside. I was an early-on career-changer. My full-time working career started in the drag racing industry where I worked for the most succesful drag racing team ever, John Force Racing.
						I had had an interest in cars and throughout highschool I had been involved in programs at school with super high mileage cars and misc engineering courses, and it was a dream jon for me.
						I worked there for nearly 4 years, and in my time there, I had worked my way onto a team as a mechanic working on one of the nitro funny cars. As cool as that job was, I came to the conclusion that it wasn't sustainable for me.
						<br>
						<br>
						This is when my enjoyment of tech took me in a new direction. I had heard of a new program from Eleven Fifty Academy that was originally was intended to be a skill-up class for existing developers. They were modifying it to be a ground-up coding course for people with zero prior coding experience.
						I figured this was a great opportunity for me to see if coding was right for me. I took a weekend intro course, and the rest is pretty much history. I was hooked nearly immediately, signed up for the course, and that has out me down the path I'm currently on.
						While I learned SO much from my time racing and am very grateful for having had it, I am equally as thankful for the opportunity I had to make the career-change when I did. It's no going back for me, I've found what I'm passionate about and that's that.

								The idea for this application came from my father, who pilots private charter jets. The
								purpose of the app, is that it makes it simple to calculate the weight and balance of an
								aircraft before it flies. It uses built in information for different aircraft to make it
								simple to give your weights as inputs, and it will tell you if the aircraft is safe to
								fly for the weights the user input. At this point in time, it is still a work in
								progress, but is close to being finished.

							<h5>The Challenge</h5>
							<p>
								This was a project I did during the 9 week Accelerated Learning Program at the Eleven
								Fifty Academy. We were instructed to take and existing project, a very simple note
								taking CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, and enhance functionality,
								design, and features of the app.
							</p>
						</article>

						<article class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
							<h5>The Solution</h5>
							<p>
								The existing project only involved notes like the second screenshot. We decided to use a
								bootstrap theme to change the basic color and look of the website. We completely changed
								the home screen to include a picture of a cat in wonder, but we also added many quotes
								and testimonials from our classmates. We also added a contact page which was functional
								and forwarded emails sent through the form to me as well as a calender on the note page.

								Ahhh, my computer... I have put so much time, effort, and quite frankly money into this monstrosity. 
								It's a passion project of mine, that has been the evolution of a hobby of mine for the past 10 or so years. 
								My computer has seen many iterations in many different forms, starting with a 'standard' case with all air-cooled components with no fancy wiring or anything. From there, I updated the computer with new parts, but otherwise moved on to a new challenge; water-cooling.
								The second iteration was a brand new computer from the ground up. This time, I learned how to make my own, custom water-cooled system. It was 'basic' for a custom loop, but was still quite a fun, new challenge, that I think I handled quite well.
								The latest incarnation is a massive, near 100-pound display case, dual custom water-cooled loop
