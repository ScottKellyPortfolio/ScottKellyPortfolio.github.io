					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						I am a fan of tech. Period. Whether it's at work learning new technologies, languages, tools, or at home reading about the latest gadgets, smartphones, computer components, whatever.
						That's what inspires me. I love learning new, techy, nerdy things.
						<br>
						<br>
						Professionally, I'm a software engineer/software developer. I specialize in 'back-end' and Microsoft technologies, such as .NET Framework, .NET Core, C#, SQL Server, but I am pretty well rounded in other technologies as well.
						I have built my own REST APIs in my own personal projects, consumed (mmmm, tasty) a myriad of other APIs, mainly REST, and have built web services and REST APIs based on existing platforms. I personally quite enjoy building, testing, and working with APIs (again, mainly REST).
						My main interests in back-end work are building de-coupled systems with API integrations, data analysis, and optimizing code. I am always wanting to learn more with algorithms, lower level operations and such, but don't have much experience with them.
						I find those challenges difficult and rewarding and would love an opportunity to learn more.
						<br>
						<br>
						I also have experience in front-end work and have done a great deal with HTML, CSS, Javascript (JS), jQuery, some Angular and React.
						I enjoy trying to learn new front-end frameworks and seeing what works well for me and what I find the most useful.
						While my focus isn't necessarily front-end work, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it or I'm not competent.
						<br>
						<br>
						Personally, I was born and raised in Brownsburg, Indiana, where I still currently reside. I was an early-on career-changer. My full-time working career started in the drag racing industry where I worked for the most succesful drag racing team ever, John Force Racing.
						I had had an interest in cars and throughout high school I had been involved in programs at school with super high mileage cars and misc engineering courses, and it was a dream job for me.
						I worked there for nearly 4 years, and in my time there, I worked my way onto a team as a mechanic working on one of the nitro funny cars. As cool as that job was, I came to the conclusion that it wasn't sustainable for me.
						<br>
						<br>
						This is when my enjoyment of tech took me in a new direction. I had heard of a new program from Eleven Fifty Academy that was originally intended to be a skill-up class for existing developers. They were modifying it to be a ground-up coding course for people with zero prior coding experience.
						I figured this was a great opportunity for me to see if coding was right for me. I took a weekend intro course, and the rest is pretty much history. I was hooked nearly immediately, signed up for the course, and that has out me down the path I'm currently on.
						While I learned SO much from my time racing and am very grateful for having had it, I am equally as thankful for the opportunity I had to make the career-change when I did. It's no going back for me, I've found what I'm passionate about and that's that.

								What started as a basic, static HTML/CSS/JS website for my brothers band has turned into my largest single personal project. As I mentioned, this website is for my brothers band, The Breakes.
								I created the site originally as a static website as a simple project when I was still very green in the world of coding. I worked with the band to design a fairly basic informational site and this is the result.
								Though it looks similar to the first iteration, it has evolved into something far more.
							</p>
							<p>
								As it was originally built as a static site, it meant that when anything needed changed, such as adding a show event or pictures or other info, I had to go and manually modify the HTML.
								This wasn't exactly maintainable, so I set out working on the second iteration of the site. What I ended up creating was something that resembles a basic CMS (Content Management System).
								While a very basic CMS, it allowed the guys, all 3 of them, access and the ability to add and manage all of their own content. This meant no more coming to me for modifying HTML.
								The site is built using ASP.NET MVC. It uses Entity Framework and a code-first pattern for all data transactions. Most of the HTML/CSS/JS was carried over, and modified to work with dynamic rendering with MVC.
								This brought along with it a few hurdles. While I was vaguely familiar with hosting a website, I hadn't full on hosted my own website. I had to figure out what to do for a hosting provider, DNS hosting, a database, the whole nine-yards.
								Though a struggle for a while, and more than one long night, it was greatly helpful in helping me understand how a website fundamentally works.
							</p>
							<p>
								The latest iteration was sort-of built on top of what was there, but not really. For my latest challenge, I decided to rebuild the site using .NET Core. While that may not sound very different from the framework I used before, functionally, it was quite different.
								This being my first proper attempt at a project using .NET Core, I decided to go all in. I re-wrote the views (HTML pages) to use more modern tag-helpers, started using Razor Pages, View Components, and still combined regular MVC patterns. There's a dab of React in there as well ;)
								I reworked what I needed to change to make authentication work with .NET Core, but I also created a full REST API with full CRUD operations for the miscellaneous aspects of the 'CMS'.
								This REST API is what I would use for my next major project; The Breakes Manager, a mobile app to manager the website content.

							<h5>The Challenge</h5>
							<p>
								Provide a modern experience, for both site consumers and content admins. This means a responsive website, with features for admins to management content with little assistance from IT/Engineering (me).
							</p>
						</article>

						<article class="col-md-4 col-sm-4">
							<h5>The Solution</h5>
							<p>
								A website that allows content admins the ability to maintain, modify and manage all content aspects of the website. The current iteration is built on a foundation .NET Core, with a myraid of other technologies.

							<h5>The Result</h5>
							<p>
								Check it out here <a href="https://thebreakes.com/" >TheBreakes.com</a>. I'm pretty proud of this site, particularly the content management side of things. I've got more things planned for the future, so this won't be the final iteration.

								I know, it's not exactly a creative name up front, but if you think about it, it's kinda like having a manager for the band, just in digital form! Right?! No? Well either way, name aside, this is the mobile app I developed for The Breakes website.
								Assuming you've made it this far after having read the project notes about The Breakes band website, you may know I briefly talked about a mobile app. This app was a self proposed challenge as a way to get into the world of mobile app development.
								The purpose of this site is to provide a mobile management experience for the band. While it may be a bit overkill, as the main website backend is responsive and can be used on a phone, this is a more streamlined process.
							</p>
							<p>
								Being a primarliy Microsoft technologies guy, I chose the obvious place to start with this; Xamarin.Forms. I set out building this using the REST API I developed during the latest iteration of the website build.
								The website uses a customized, scaffolded, Identity Server pattern for authenticating users and OAuth for the workflow. This meant that I had to adopt that with this mobile app to gain access to the API.
								I took an approach of caching a users login information to their device to avoid having to login everytim they open the app. Within the app, they have all of the standard management options as the website.
								This has the advantage for uploading different types of media such as videos and images, as they can upload directly from their phones.
								The app is not entirely finished, and I envision it going on for a while, but it's been a good experience.

								Ahhh, my computer... I have put so much time, effort, and quite frankly money into this monstrosity. 
								It's a passion project of mine, that has been the evolution of a hobby of mine for the past 10 or so years. 
								My computer has seen many iterations in many different forms, starting with a 'standard' case with all air-cooled components with no fancy wiring or anything. From there, I updated the computer with new parts, but otherwise moved on to a new challenge; water-cooling.
								The second iteration was a brand new computer from the ground up. This time, I learned how to make my own, custom water-cooled system. It was 'basic' for a custom loop, but was still quite a fun, new challenge, that I think I handled quite well.
								The latest incarnation is a massive, near 100-pound display case, dual custom water-cooled loop

								The idea for this application came from my father, who pilots private charter jets. The
								purpose of the app, is that it makes it simple to calculate the weight and balance of an
								aircraft before it flies. It uses built in information for different aircraft to make it
								simple to give your weights as inputs, and it will tell you if the aircraft is safe to
								fly for the weights the user input. At this point in time, it is still a work in
								progress, but is close to being finished.
