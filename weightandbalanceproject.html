	<h4>This is about what the user interface would look like.  One point of the app was to make it as simple as possible for the user.  The user need only select an aircraft from a list of aircraft.  That specific aircraft will have specific values and information specific to that aircraft.  This eliminates the need for the user to input most of the data.  The user only needs to input the weights for each area of the airplane and the functions and calculations will be automatically calculated.  This allows quick use and convenience for the user.</h4>
